      <p>
        For the above idea, it seemed like the sensors would be hard to test and calibrate in real time,
        so I wanted to do something that would be more feasible to debug. Also, I wanted to incorporate more coding,
        but this idea didn't involve a lot of that.

            nice to have to be able to play with a dedicated input device.

      <h1>Minesweeper</h1>
      <h2>Description</h2>
      <pre>
Plays a modified version of minesweeper.
- same as normal minesweeper:
  - 9x9 board with 10 mines randomly planted (beginner difficulty)
  - restart the game at any time
  - remaining mines and seconds passed timer display
  - smiley for indicating game state
- different:
  - when you hit a mine, the timer stops as normal,
    but you can keep going and solve the rest of the board
    - the mouse hold smiley is instead used
      to indicate "winning" after already losing

Takes inputs from keyboard and Arduino through serial comm

Keyboard:
- r: restart
- e: dig
- f: flag
- WASD or arrow keys: move

Arduino:
- 7 buttons on infrared remote:
          VOL+
     |<<  >||  >>|
      v   VOL-  ^
- corresponding to:
           up
    left  down  right
    dig   flag  restart

The IR receiver sends the value received on each relevant
button press, and otherwise a continuous stream to indicate
that no button was just pressed.
The red indicator light on the receiver blinks when a signal is received.

The IR receiver is connected to pin 9,
receives power through pin 10,
and is connected to ground at pin 11.
      </pre>
      <h2>Development Notes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I started with a joystick using the built-in switch and then 1 other button, but often pressing the joystick
          would move it as well, so I changed to 2 button switches and stopped using the built-in switch.
        </li>
        <li>
          I started with moving the joystick a distance from the center would move the cursor 1 cell in that direction,
          but the input was too sensitive, so I changed to a linear mapping for the full range of motion of the joystick
          to the dimensions of the board.
        </li>
        <li>
          With mapping, it was still too sensitive and the response speed was too high, so I changed
          to 2 separate twist knob potentiometers instead of having them combined in the joystick.
        </li>
        <li>
          On the contrary, the response speed for the potentiometers was too low, and the 2 potentiometers also felt
          like an unintuitive, unfamiliar interaction for moving around a board, so I decided to use an infrared remote.
          I would have used button switches for each, but I did not have access to that many buttons, and mounting the
          buttons on a casing would be much more complex, so the remote was a better option.
        </li>
        <li>
          In terms of coding the game functionality, I was using coordinate point arrays as elements in my sets, so two
          arrays with the same values in them would be considered as different and both be added to the set, because
          sets compare elements by object references and not contents, so the best solution for me was to convert the
          2 values into 1 string and use that for set elements instead. The same applied for map keys.
        </li>
        <li>
          At first the board had no HUD, so there was no feedback when a game was won, so I added the smiley back in.
          Since that meant the HUD was there, I added the other two parts of it (mines, timer) as well. The mines count
          is sometimes needed to determine mine locations near the end of a game, but the timer is just for fun.
        </li>
        <li>
          I started with only the arrow keys for inputs and an intuitive d for dig, but I wanted to be able to play
          with one hand, so I added WASD along with the arrow keys and changed d into e for dig.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Schematic</h2>
      <img id="fp-sch" style="width:30%;" src="assets/fp/schematic.jpg" alt="schematic">
      <p>
        Instead of the built in GND and 5V pins, I used pin 11 and pin 10, which were adjacent to the input pin 9,
        so the wiring would be more secure inside the product casing.
      </p>
